# Papeg.ai

This is the source code for Papeg.ai, a website that offers popular AI features such as chat and document editing, and makes them free, easy to use and completely private.

See the code in action here:
https://papeg.ai

## TRANSPARENCY
Papeg.ai runs completely client-side, which means you always have access to the complete source code as it's running inside your web browser. The code is placed here as a convenience, to make inspecting it as easy as possible. 

This project was developed by a self-taught digital artist from Amsterdam, not a professional development team. You should not rely on papeg.ai for anything serious or mission-critical.


## WEBSITE LICENSE

You may use the online version at https://papeg.ai (and the beta version at https://papegai.eu) freely in any situation. If you use it in a corporate context, then you are honour-bound to get in touch and help to financially support the project (and in turn allow me to support the projects and services that make papeg.ai possible). A monthly fee of 2 euro per user is suggested.
